(chunt 11-26-2018) this isnt fully configured yet to be run from this dockerfile

TODO:
  workspace
    setup workspace with "good" project
    add to artifacts folder for docker build
  
  update dockerfile to setup jenkins (first launch requires some configuration; initialAdminPassword, plugin setup, admin user creation)
  
  update dockerfile with workspace
  
  check ports for restful api invocation
  
  spin up sca docker container during build
    add docker container support to jenkins (docker plugin should be installed already, verify)
    make sca an agent that takes the commands/workspace/anything else it needs
  
  preconfigure ssc url (http://ssc.fortify.com/ssc) for fortify plugin
    the fortify plugin is added in the docker build because it is not on the jenkins marketplace (chunt)
  
  investigate preconfigure for all plugins (yaml)
